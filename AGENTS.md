# Silo organization metadata

This repository owns Silo's organization-wide community health files and
profile documentation. Keep shared policy here general enough to apply across
the organization; implementation guidance belongs in the owning repository.

## Writing

Run a final readability pass on every human-facing issue, pull request,
document, or status update.

- Lead with the outcome.
- Use concrete, plain language and active voice.
- Cut filler, stock framing, repetition, and promotional claims.
- Preserve meaning, evidence, citations, uncertainty, and established
  terminology.
- Never rewrite exact quotations, commands, logs, identifiers, API names, or
  contractual language.
- Match the tone to the audience and use only formatting that improves
  readability.

## Pull requests

Never create a pull request unless the developer explicitly asks for one.

Use a Conventional Commit title in plain language. Start the body with the
problem, explain the solution next, and end with the required AI disclosure,
including the exact model identifier, agent harness, and any other AI tooling.
Include repository-required issue links, validation evidence, risks, and
follow-up work.

- Keep one concern per pull request. If an honest description needs the word
  "also," split the work.
- Include before-and-after images for UI changes. Include a short video when
  motion or timing matters.
- Upload pull request evidence to GitHub. Never commit PR-only assets such as
  `.github/pr-assets/`.
- When babysitting a pull request, poll checks and review comments created
  after the last push. Verify bot findings against the source, fix real issues,
  and dismiss false positives with a written reason. Remain quiet when nothing
  new has appeared. Stop when the latest commit is green.
